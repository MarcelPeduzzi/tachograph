// CertificateResolver provides access to tachograph certificates needed for

// by their Certificate Holder Reference (CHR). The default implementation uses
// embedded certificates from EU member states and falls back to fetching from
// remote sources.

// DefaultCertificateResolver returns the default certificate resolver.
//
// The default resolver uses a chain of certificate sources:
//  1. Embedded certificates from EU member states (fast, offline)
//  2. Remote certificate fetching via HTTP (fallback, requires network)
//
// This resolver is suitable for most use cases and provides good performance
// while ensuring compatibility with certificates from all EU member states.
//
// The resolver is initialized lazily and cached for subsequent calls.
